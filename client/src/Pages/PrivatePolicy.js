            Automatic Logging of Session Data
          </h2>
          <p>
            We may automatically log generic information about your computer's
            connection to the Internet, which we call 'session data', that is
            anonymous and not linked to any Personal Information. Session data
            consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of
            browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user
            while on the Site.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the
            internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to
            the user, such as the pages of the Site the user wishes to view. We
            may collect session data to analyse, for example, what items
            visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking
            through the Site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on
            the Site, how long visitors to the Site are staying on it and how
            often they are visiting.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us
            better administer our systems. Although such information does not
            identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an
            IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the
            approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
